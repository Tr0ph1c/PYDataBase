#PYDataBase

This script uses a .txt file to store a python dictionary created 
by the user using the interface, which could then be loaded and 
edited using a set key for each element in the database.

--------- This is the current state of the project ---------

I will use this repository to actually learn how to implement SQL
databases from python.
